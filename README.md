# SQL Project: Company Database Management

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts designed for managing a company database. These scripts cover various aspects of SQL, including creating databases, inserting data, executing basic and nested queries, and using important SQL clauses.

## Repository Contents

1. **Creating A Company Database.txt**  
   This script contains SQL commands to create a new company database, including tables for employees, departments, and other relevant entities. It defines the structure of the database by specifying the necessary tables, columns, and data types.

2. **Inserting Data Into a Company Database.txt**  
   This script includes SQL commands to insert sample data into the company database. It provides data for employees, departments, and other entities, allowing users to populate the database with initial data for testing and development purposes.

3. **Some Basic Queries.txt**  
   This script contains basic SQL queries to retrieve, update, and delete data from the company database. It covers essential SQL operations like `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` to manipulate the data in various ways.

4. **Nested Queries.txt**  
   This script includes examples of nested queries (subqueries) that allow users to perform more complex data retrieval tasks. It demonstrates the use of subqueries to filter, aggregate, and transform data within the database.

5. **Some Important SQL Clauses.txt**  
   This script provides examples of important SQL clauses such as `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`. It helps users understand how to effectively use these clauses to filter, group, and sort data in SQL.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Your Database Environment**  
   Ensure you have a SQL-compatible database management system (DBMS) installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite).

2. **Create the Company Database**  
   Use the commands in `Creating A Company Database.txt` to create the company database and its tables.

3. **Insert Sample Data**  
   Run the commands in `Inserting Data Into a Company Database.txt` to populate the database with initial data for testing.

4. **Execute SQL Queries**  
   Utilize the scripts `Some Basic Queries.txt`, `Nested Queries.txt`, and `Some Important SQL Clauses.txt` to perform various operations and queries on the company database.

## Requirements

- A SQL-compatible DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite).
